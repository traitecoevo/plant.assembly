# Tests for the Geritz, van der Meijden & Metz 1999 seed-size safe-site model
# (issue #33; the model in Daniel's MATLAB). There is no closed-form singular
# strategy, so the strong analytic oracle is the demographic-equilibrium
# invariant W_m(m) = 1 (log fitness 0); singular-strategy locations are
# regression values cross-checked against the paper's qualitative Fig. 5
# behaviour (alpha*R = 4.5 -> CSS, alpha*R = 7 -> branching at beta*R = 15).
