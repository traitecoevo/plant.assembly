# Plant SCM smoke tests (issue #27).
#
# The model-agnostic pipeline (demography, selection gradient, fitness
# landscape, attractor solving, assembly, the alternative equilibrium solvers,
# util_nlsolve, inviable-strategy checks) is exercised fast on the DD99 toy
# harness elsewhere. This file keeps a *minimal* set of genuine plant-SCM runs
# as the integration anchor: it is the only place that confirms the real
# physiological model still drives the regnans pipeline, and it pins the
# reference values for the installed plant (2.0.0.9001).
#
# These are the slow tests in the suite (a few seconds per SCM solve,
# max_patch_lifetime = 30 via helper-assembly.R). Keep the count small, and
# prefer cheap gradient checks over full iterative solves where they give the
# same coverage (see the attractor test below).
