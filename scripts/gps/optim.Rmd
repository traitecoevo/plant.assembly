## Approximatign Black Box functions and Bayeisan optimisation

GPRs have been used as suurogates/emulators to approximate black box models

Once a surrogate is available, it can be used for futher taks, like finding optima or passing into an MCMC algorithm for parametrisation (e.g. [Fer et al 2018](10.5194/bg-15-5801-2018))

[Bayeisan optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization) involves finding a maximum/minimum, by iterative fits of a GP.  In previous work with Rich we used this in a DIY setup. But there's a bunch of packages that enable this, including
  - mlr3mbo: https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3mbo/
  - ParBayesianOptimization: https://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/ParBayesianOptimization
  - tidymodels: https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_grid.html#ref-examples

the same tools are often used for tuning Hyperparameters of ML models (Bischl et al )

## Differential evolution

WIKipedia: [Differential evolution (DE)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_evolution)
  - method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. Such methods are commonly known as metaheuristics as they make few or no assumptions about the optimized problem and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. However, metaheuristics such as DE do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found.
  - DE is used for multidimensional real-valued functions but does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means DE does not require the optimization problem to be differentiable, as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi-newton methods. DE can therefore also be used on optimization problems that are not even continuous, are noisy, change over time, etc.
  - DE optimizes a problem by maintaining a population of candidate solutions and creating new candidate solutions by combining existing ones according to its simple formulae, and then keeping whichever candidate solution has the best score or fitness on the optimization problem at hand. In this way, the optimization problem is treated as a black box that merely provides a measure of quality given a candidate solution and the gradient is therefore not needed.

## Root finding

I'm curious here to see how well prepackged tools work, also to see if we can use them for root finding. 

## Fer et al 2018

uses mlegp package https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlegp/index.html

"In this study, we fitted a Gaussian process (GP) model as our statistical emulator, using the mlegp (v3.1.4) package in R (Dancik, 2013). GP assumes that the covariance between any set of points in parameter space is multivariate Gaussian, and the correlation between points decreases as the distance between them increases (mlegp uses a power exponential autocorrelation function). We chose a GP model as our emulator because of its desirable properties. First, because GP is an interpolator rather than a smoother it will always pass exactly through the design points. Second, GP allows for the estimation of uncertainties associated with interpolation – uncertainty for a GP model will converge smoothly to zero at the design points (knots, Fig. 1). Third, among nonparametric approaches, GP is shown to be the best emulator construction method (Wang et al., 2014). The GP model is essentially the anisotropic multivariate generalization of the Kriging model commonly employed in geostatistics (Sacks et al., 1989). Because we are dealing with a deterministic model, we assume that the variance at a lag of distance zero, known as the nugget in geostatistics, is equal to zero, but this assumption could be relaxed for stochastic models. We do not go into further details of GP modeling, or its comparison to other emulator methods, since both are well documented elsewhere Kennedy and O’Hagan, 2001; Rasmussen and Williams, 2006)."

Note point about nugget = 0 --> important when using GP as emulator


# Fitness maxima with plant example

```{r}

  ctrl <- scm_base_control()
  ctrl$equilibrium_nsteps <- 20
  ctrl$equilibrium_solver_name <- "hybrid"
  ctrl
}

# set baseline parameters

ctrl <- scm_base_control()
ctrl$save_RK45_cache <- T

```

```{r}
trait <- 0.04045

# setup the assembler to start with empty community
community0 <-
  community_start(
    p0,
    bounds(lma = c(0.01, 2)),
    fitness_control = list(type = "grid")
  )

p <- community_parameters(community)
```

Make a function optimise using mutant method

```{r}

scm <- run_scm(p, use_ode_times = TRUE, ctrl = ctrl)

make_f <- function(scm) {
  function(x) {
    traits <- plant::trait_matrix(exp(x), "lma")
    p_mutants <- expand_parameters(traits, p, keep_existing_strategies = FALSE)

    count <<- count + 1

    scm$run_mutant(p_mutants)
    log(scm$net_reproduction_ratios)
  }
}

count <- 0
f <- make_f(scm)
f(log(0.05))
f(log(trait))

x <- seq_log(0.01, 3, length.out = 50)
y <- purrr::map_dbl(log(x), f)

xopt = x[y==max(y)]
yopt <- y[y == max(y)]

plot(x, y, log = "x", type = "l")
abline(h=0, lty = "dashed")
points(trait, f(log(trait)),  col="black")
points(xopt, yopt, col = "red")


```

## R's optimisation

optimise is for 1D optimisation, but not guaranteed to give global solution
```{r}
# local maximisation 
count <- 0
xmax <- optimise(f, maximum = TRUE, lower = log(0.01), upper = log(2))
exp(xmax$maximum)
count

plot(x, y, log = "x", type = "l")
abline(h = 0, lty = "dashed")
points(trait, f(log(trait)), col = "black")
points(xopt, yopt, col = "red")
points(exp(xmax$maximum), xmax$objective, col = "blue")
```

Yay! 


## Bayesian_optimization via `ParBayesianOptimization`

```{r}
library(ParBayesianOptimization)

FUN <- function(x) list(Score = f(x))

f(log(0.0825)) == FUN(log(0.0825))$Score

bounds <- list(x = log(c(0.01,2)))
initGrid <- data.frame(x = log(c(0.01, 1, 2)))

set.seed(6)
count <- 0
optObjSimp <- bayesOpt(
  FUN = FUN
  , bounds = bounds
  , initGrid = initGrid
  , iters.n = 10,
  acqThresh = 0.8
)
count
```

Let’s see how close the algorithm got to the global maximum:

```{r}
xopt2 <- exp(getBestPars(optObjSimp)$x)
yopt2 <- f(log(xopt2))


plot(x, y, log = "x", type = "l")
abline(h = 0, lty = "dashed")
points(trait, f(log(trait)), col = "black")
points(xopt, yopt, col = "red")
points(exp(xmax$maximum), xmax$objective, col = "blue")
points(xopt2, yopt2, col = "green")
points(exp(optObjSimp$scoreSummary$x), optObjSimp$scoreSummary$Score, col = "#014d01", pch= "x")

## Space filling deisgns

What is we just want to create a good design of a space and fit a surrogate?

We can use the same tools 

- see https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/chapters/chapter5/advanced_tuning_methods_and_black_box_optimization.html#sec-bayesian-optimization-blocks

- specify a design, could be grid, or latin hypercube or others, see https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/chapters/chapter5/advanced_tuning_methods_and_black_box_optimization.html#fig-bayesian-optimization-designs
  - Whichever of these methods you choose, the result is a Design object, which is mostly just a wrapper around a data.table
  - could also specify a completely custom initial design by defining your own data.table. 
  - Either way, when manually constructing an initial design (as opposed to letting loop_function automate this), it needs to be evaluated on the OptimInstance before optimizing it

```{r}
library(bbotk)
library(mlr3mbo)
library(mlr3learners)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# specifiy domain
domain = ps(x = p_dbl(lower = log(0.01), upper = log(2)))

# specify function
obfun <- ObjectiveRFun$new(
  fun = function(xs) list(y = f(xs$x)),
  domain = domain,
  codomain = ps(y = p_dbl(tags = "maximize"))
)

# Create the design
# initial_design <- data.table(x = log(c(0.02, 0.04, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 2)))
#initial_design <- generate_design_grid(domain, resolution = 10)
initial_design <- generate_design_lhs(domain, n = 20)

# start instance to evaluate function
instance <- OptimInstanceSingleCrit$new(
  objective = obfun,
  terminator = trm("evals", n_evals = 10)
)
instance$eval_batch(initial_design$data)

# see the data
instance$archive$data

# Now fit surrogate

lrn_gp <- lrn("regr.km",
  covtype = "matern3_2", optim.method = "BFGS",
  control = list(trace = FALSE)
)

surrogate <- srlrn(lrn_gp, archive = instance$archive)

surrogate$update()
surrogate$learner$model

# points for plotting
xdt <- data.table(x = seq_range(log(c(0.01, 2)), length.out = 101))
surrogate_pred <- surrogate$predict(xdt)
xdt[, c("y", "se") := surrogate_pred]

# plot true function in black
# surrogate prediction (mean +- se in grey)
# known optimum in darkred
# found optimum in darkgreen
instance$archive$data %>% as_tibble() %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(data = tibble(x= log(x), y), col = "red") +
  geom_line(data = xdt, col="black") +
  geom_ribbon(data = xdt, aes(x = x, ymin = y - se, ymax = y + se), fill = "grey", alpha = 0.2) +
  theme_minimal()

```

### We can change the acquisition function to change the way Bayes Opt refines?

- lots of acquisiton functions available `as.data.table(mlr_acqfunctions)`
- could build own lopp function, which chooses new points
  - https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/chapters/chapter5/advanced_tuning_methods_and_black_box_optimization.html#sec-bayesian-optimization-loop

```{r}
optimizer <- opt("mbo",

  acq_function = acqf("sd"),
  acq_optimizer = acqo(opt("nloptr", algorithm = "NLOPT_GN_ORIG_DIRECT"),
    terminator = trm("stagnation", iters = 100, threshold = 1e-5))
  )

obfun <- ObjectiveRFun$new(
  fun = function(xs) list(y = f(xs$x)),
  domain = ps(x = p_dbl(lower = log(0.01), upper = log(2))),
  codomain = ps(y = p_dbl(tags = "maximize"))
)

initial_design <- data.table(x = sort(c(log(p$strategies[[1]]$lma), seq_range(log(c(0.01, 2)), 10))))

instance <- OptimInstanceSingleCrit$new(
  objective = obfun,
  terminator = trm("evals", n_evals = 20)
)
instance$eval_batch(initial_design)

optimizer$optimize(instance)

instance$result

# call one more update on surrogate to make sure it's cpatured the last point (see https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3mbo/issues/131)
optimizer$surrogate$update()

# make predictions
xdt <- data.table(x = seq_range(log(c(0.01, 2)), length.out = 101))
surrogate_pred <- optimizer$surrogate$predict(xdt)
xdt[, c("y", "se") := surrogate_pred]

# plot true function in red, surrogate prediction (mean +- se in black/ grey)
instance$archive$data %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +

# Solving 1D attractors 

for this suggest building gp of Sg then passing to root finder

## Bayesian optimisation

Answer: not really because there's also zero selection at bounds and the alogrithm often finds this. 


Root finding requires findo zero crosserover. 

I investigated whether we could reform the root fining problem as an optimistaion problem. To some extent yes. 

Root finding involves finding point where
$$f(x)=0$$
whereas an optiomsation probem involves finding the point
$$\frac{dg(x)}{dx}=0, \,\, f(x) = \frac{dg(x)}{dx}$$

Folloieng the example at https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/94638/finding-the-attractors-of-the-vector-field-constructed-as-the-gradient-of-an-int, they suggest calculation a fitness function from the selection gradient using the
[`norm`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Norm.html). 

I tried this, but we encountered a problem that the selection gradient goes to zero towards the outer bounds of trait values. This means there's potentially three zeros and the opimisation can easily move towards the boundary point. 


Make a function optimise using mutant method

  # Add a startegy specified by it's trait value
